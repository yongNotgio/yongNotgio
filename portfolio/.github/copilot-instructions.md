Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot.

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (React + Vite + Tailwind portfolio with static data)
- [x] Scaffold the Project (Vite React structure with Tailwind/PostCSS config)
- [x] Customize the Project (Navbar, Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Awards, Footer)
- [x] Install Required Extensions (none required)
- [ ] Compile the Project (npm install, npm run build pending)
- [ ] Create and Run Task (add VS Code task if needed after install)
- [ ] Launch the Project (npm run dev after dependencies are installed; confirm debug mode)
- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete (final verification after compile)

Execution Guidelines
- Track progress in the task list and update after each step.
- Keep communication concise; if a step is skipped, note it briefly.
- Use the current directory as project root; avoid extra folders.
- Do not install extensions unless explicitly provided by get_project_setup_info.
- Avoid unnecessary media or external links; use placeholders only with a note.
- Provide clear instructions to debug or launch the project once ready.
